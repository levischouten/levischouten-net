Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular code editor known for its flexibility and extensive marketplace of extensions. While many developers are aware of the essential extensions, there are some hidden gems that can greatly enhance productivity and save valuable time. In this blog post, we will explore three underrated VS Code extensions that you might not be using yet but should definitely consider adding to your toolkit.

### Multiple cursor case preserve

Working with multiple cursors in VS Code is a powerful feature, but it often poses challenges when maintaining proper casing. When modifying occurrences of a word in multiple places, the camel case tends to break, causing inconsistencies. The Multiple cursor case preserve extension comes to the rescue by preserving the original casing. With this extension, you can ensure consistent and accurate casing changes across your code, as shown in the example below:

### Template String Converter

Converting regular strings to template strings can be a tedious task. The Template String Converter extension simplifies this process by automatically converting regular strings to template strings when you type ${. This time-saving feature eliminates the need for manual conversion. Take a look at the demo below to see it in action:
