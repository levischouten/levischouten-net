Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular code editor known for its flexibility and extensive marketplace of extensions. While many developers are aware of the essential extensions, there are some hidden gems that can greatly enhance productivity and save valuable time. In this blog post, we will explore three underrated VS Code extensions that you might not be using yet but should definitely consider adding to your toolkit.

Working with multiple cursors in VS Code is a powerful feature, but it often poses challenges when maintaining proper casing. When modifying occurrences of a word in multiple places, the camel case tends to break, causing inconsistencies. The Multiple cursor case preserve extension comes to the rescue by preserving the original casing. With this extension, you can ensure consistent and accurate casing changes across your codebase, as shown in the example below:
